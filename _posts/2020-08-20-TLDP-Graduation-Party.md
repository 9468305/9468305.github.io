2020.05.20 - 2020.08.20，转眼三个月过去，Trip.com Group “TLDP 管理者程长训练营”毕业了。三个小时的结业典礼，段子与戏谑齐飞，满堂欢笑。  
集团 CEO 女神姐姐专程赶来做开场致辞，过去的半年，携程经历了至暗时期，就像“敦刻尔克大撤退”之后的英国。

> Winston Churchill
>
> I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat......You ask, what is our aim? I can answer in one word: It is victory, victory at all costs, victory in spite of all terror, victory, however long and hard the road may be; for without victory, there is no survival.
>
> We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British Fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old.

我们扛住了，疫情之后，携程只会更好。
